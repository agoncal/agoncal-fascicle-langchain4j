      <h2>Early Development (1970s)</h2>
      <img src="https://example.com/early_cd_development.jpg" alt="Early CD Development">
      <p>In the 1970s, Philips and Sony began developing a new digital audio disc. The result was the compact disc (CD),
        a medium that would revolutionize the music industry. The primary goal was to create a high-fidelity audio
        format that could hold more music than vinyl records or cassette tapes.</p>

      <h2>Introduction of the Compact Disc (1982)</h2>
      <img src="https://example.com/first_cd_player.jpg" alt="First CD Player">
      <p>The first commercial CD, Billy Joel's "52nd Street," was released in Japan on October 1, 1982. Sony and Philips
        launched the first CD players shortly after. The superior sound quality and durability of CDs compared to vinyl
        records and cassette tapes quickly gained popularity among consumers.</p>

      <h2>CDs in the Mainstream (1980s-1990s)</h2>
      <img src="https://example.com/cd_collection.jpg" alt="CD Collection">
      <p>By the late 1980s and early 1990s, CDs had become the dominant format for music. The ability to skip tracks,
        improved audio quality, and increased storage capacity made CDs the preferred choice for both consumers and
        artists. The music industry saw significant growth in sales, driven by the CD boom.</p>

      <h2>Technological Advancements</h2>
      <img src="https://example.com/cd_technology.jpg" alt="CD Technology">
      <p>Several advancements improved CD technology over the years. The introduction of CD-R (recordable) and CD-RW
        (rewritable) discs allowed users to create their own CDs. Enhanced audio formats like HDCD and Super Audio CD
        (SACD) provided even higher sound quality. Additionally, CDs were used for data storage in computers, further
        broadening their applications.</p>

      <h2>Decline and Digital Transition (2000s-Present)</h2>
      <img src="https://example.com/streaming.jpg" alt="Digital Streaming">
      <p>The 2000s saw the rise of digital music formats and online streaming services, leading to a decline in CD
        sales. MP3 players, and later smartphones, offered greater convenience and portability. Despite this, CDs remain
        popular among audiophiles and collectors, and are still used for physical music distribution by many
        artists.</p>
