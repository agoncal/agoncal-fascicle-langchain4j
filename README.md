# AGoncal Fascicle: Understanding LangChain4j

Code of my [LangChain4j Fascicle](https://agoncal.teachable.com/p/ebook-understanding-langchain4j).

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming the way we develop and interact with software applications.
Integrating these advanced technologies into Java applications, however, can be a daunting task due to their complexity and the sheer volume of concepts involved.

That's where [LangChain4j](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j) comes into play.

In this [fascicle](https://agoncal.teachable.com), you will learn LangChain4j, the Java library that simplifies the integration of AI and LLMs into your applications.
You will explore the fundamentals of AI, learn the history and evolution of AI models, and understand the core concepts of LangChain4j.
From accessing and invoking large language models to manipulating embeddings in vector databases, you will gain hands-on experience through practical examples and code snippets.
Additionally, you will discover advanced topics such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), debugging, testing, and integrating LangChain4j with other technologies.

Foreword by [Dmytro Liubarskyi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmytro-liubarskyi)

> Dear Reader,
<br/><br/>
Welcome to this book on LangChain4j!
<br/><br/>
I’m Dmytro Liubarskyi, the developer behind LangChain4j. My passion for both Java and artificial
intelligence led me to create LangChain4j, a library that connects the worlds of Generative AI and
Java.
<br/><br/>
In the rapidly changing field of GenAI (Generative AI), finding comprehensive and up-to-date
resources can be challenging. That’s why this book stands out. It not only demonstrates the
capabilities of LangChain4j but also provides an in-depth exploration of the latest GenAI concepts.
<br/><br/>
I’m honoured that Antonio has dedicated his time and expertise to this book. He is an exceptional
writer, known for his ability to make complex topics easy to understand. In these pages, he makes
GenAI concepts clear and practical for Java developers.
<br/><br/>
Whether you’re new to AI development or already experienced, I’m confident you’ll find valuable
insights in these pages. I’m excited for you to explore how LangChain4j can help you build AI-
enhanced applications.
<br/><br/>
