# AGoncal Fascicle: Understanding Quarkus

Code of my Understanding LangChain4j Fascicle

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming the way we develop and interact with software applications.
Integrating these advanced technologies into Java applications, however, can be a daunting task due to their complexity and the sheer volume of concepts involved.

Thatâ€™s when LangChain4j comes into play.

In this fascicle, you will learn LangChain4j, the Java library that simplifies the integration of AI and LLMs into your applications.
You will explore the fundamentals of AI, learn the history and evolution of AI models, and understand the core concepts of LangChain4j.
From accessing and invoking large language models to manipulating embeddings in vector databases, you will gain hands-on experience through practical examples and code snippets.
Additionally, you will discover advanced topics such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), debugging, testing, and integrating LangChain4j with other technologies.
